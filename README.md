# Vulnerability Scanner

## Overview

**Vulnerability Scanner** is a Python-based network and website scanning tool designed to identify common security vulnerabilities, such as open ports, outdated software versions, and misconfigurations. This tool features a user-friendly GUI developed with PyQt5, allowing users to perform vulnerability assessments easily without requiring root privileges.

### Key Features

- **Open Port Scanning**: Detect open TCP ports on a target system using both Nmap and socket-based scanning methods.
- **Vulnerability Detection**: Check for outdated software versions and common misconfigurations on web servers.
- **Real-Time Updates**: View live progress updates during scans for better user experience.
- **Customizable Scans**: Specify custom port ranges and save scan results for future analysis.
- **Error Handling**: Detailed error messages to help diagnose and resolve issues during scanning.
- **Security Best Practices**: Includes disclaimers and ethical use policies to promote responsible scanning.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vulnerability-scanner.git
   cd vulnerability-scanner
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Install the required Python libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install python-nmap PyQt5 requests
   ```

   Also, ensure Nmap is installed on your system:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install nmap
   ```

### Usage

1. **Run the Application:**

   Execute the script to launch the GUI application:

   ```bash
   python3 code.py
   ```

2. **Perform Scans:**

   - **Enter Target IP or URL**: Specify the IP address or URL you want to scan.
   - **Specify Port Range**: Define a custom port range (default is `1-1024`).
   - **Scan Open Ports**: Click "Scan Open Ports" to detect open ports on the target system.
   - **Scan Vulnerabilities**: Click "Scan Vulnerabilities" to check for outdated software and other security issues.
   - **Save Results**: Use the "Save Results" button to store the scan output in a file.

### Example Output

- **Open Ports:**
  ```
  Scanning open ports on 192.168.1.1...
  Open Ports:
  Port 22 is open
  Port 80 is open
  ```
